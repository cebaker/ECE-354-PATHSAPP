                  <p>Saahil "UNiVeRsE" Arora is a decorated DotA veteran, having competed in all four of Valve's yearly Dota 2 championships, The International. UNiVeRsE has become a fixture in the North American DotA scene as one of the most talented offlaners the West has to offer, being best known for his Dark Seer.</p>
                  <p>UNiVeRsE was part of the Online Kingdom squad, along side Fear, that placed 7th at The International 2011. Following The International, he had short stints with It’s Gosu and Quantic in which he showcased his considerable talent. Eventually UNiVeRsE would join his former teammate Fear on EG as their new hard support player. In the months leading up to the second International, UNiVeRsE helped EG to a Top 4 finish at DreamHack Summer 2012 as well as the BeyondTheSummit World Tour. </p>
                  <p>On May 25, 2012, Saahil along with the rest of EG was invited to participate in the The International 2012 in order to compete for its $1,600,000 prize pool. After impressing in the group stage, they were knocked out from the winner bracket by the team that would proceed to win the tournament, invictus Gaming, with a 1-2 score. Their run in the loser bracket would prove to be short, as they were knocked out immediately by TongFu. Following The International 2, UNiVeRsE took a short hiatus from DotA to focus on his studies and on September 12, 2012, Evil Geniuses and UNiVeRsE parted ways.</p>

                  <p>Peter "ppd" Dager is an American player from Fort Wayne, Indiana and is currently the captain of team Evil Geniuses.After switching to Dota 2 together with Heroes of Newerth teammate zai, ppd quickly became one of the most influential strategists in the scene, often being praised for his ability to constantly out draft his opponents. Being one of the more outspoken players in the scene, ppd is often referred to as the Salt King. Despite having won around one hundred thousand dollars in prize money with team Evil Geniuses, ppd is very frugal with the money made off his wins, currently living in a small condo with friends and drives a 1999 Chevy Blazer "with a large dent in the side". </p>
                  <p>Peter began his eSports career with Heroes of Newerth, where he initially played under the alias "peterpandam" (which later became the acronym 'PPD'). His first team was Trademark eSports, and he began to experiment with many other teams until he found a more solid position with compLexity in 2012. Peter came in second place at both DreamHoN Winter 2012 and DreamHoN Summer 2013 with the compLexity HoN division.</p>
                  <p>Near the end of 2013, ppd followed the lead of many HoN pros before him and transitioned to Dota 2. Initially playing for few lesser known teams, he played on StayFree with teammate Zai. After The International 3, his talents earned him recruitment to Super Strong Dinosaurs with established players ComeWithMe and Sneyking. His short stay with the team included a 2nd place finish at Bigpoint Battle #8 where he was defeated by EG. After the disbandment of SSD, ppd and Zai teamed up with Fear, UNiVeRsE, and Arteezy under the moniker S A D B O Y S. ppd took over the captain and drafting duties from Fear, and he immediately proved his worth with innovative styles of drafting. Together the team went on a 19-game win streak including a 1st place finish in the Electronic Sports Prime/Shock Therapy Cup.</p>
