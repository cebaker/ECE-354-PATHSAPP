              <p>Patrik Lindberg (born June 10, 1988), known by the pseudonym f0rest, is a Swedish professional gamer, who is known for his long-standing superior performance in the competitive Counter-Strike scene. Having played competitively since 2005, Lindberg, has widely gained a reputation within the esports scene as one of the best-performing Counter-Strike players in the world. Lindberg is best known for his four years of tenure on the Fnatic roster, which he helped bring to prominence as the dominant team of 2009, during which year the team broke the record for the highest-earning team in Counter-Strike history. Near the end of 2010, Lindberg left Fnatic and joined SK Gaming, which he remained with until July 2012. Soon after, he transitioned over to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and joined the team Ninjas in Pyjamas.</p>
              <p>Lindberg began his professional gaming career in early 2005, when he made his international debut at the global finals in South Korea for the World e-Sports Games, alongside the new Swedish team of Begrip Gaming. There, Begrip defeated all opponents, including the defending champions Catch-Gamers and won the prize pot of 50,000 USD.[6] Following this victory, Lindberg dropped out of high school to concentrate on his Counter-Strike career.[7] In 2005, Lindberg was nominated for the eSports Award 2005, under the categories for "Newcomer of the Year" and "Best Counter-Strike Player".[8] In early 2006, Lindberg left Begrip alongside his teammate Kristoffer "Tentpole" Nordlund, and signed a contract with Fnatic and became a permanent member of the team.</p>
              <p>Lindberg's first year in Fnatic proved to be successful, having the team earn upwards of $100,000 USD, which was acknowledged by Turtle Entertainment. During 2006, Fnatic won the Cyberathlete Professional League Championship, the World Tour, along with a silver medal at the Electronic Sports World Cup. Lindberg was once again nominated for the eSports Award and won the Counter-Strike Player of the Year Award.</p>

              <p>Patrik cArn Sättermon, 28, is a former Counter-Strike in-game leader representing Fnatic since 2006, with more than 60 international top3 placements and team of the year award 2006 and 2009.After playing several years for Fnatic, Patrik "cArn" Sättermon, one of the best CS:1.6 players became the Chief Gaming Officer of Fnatic in 2012.</p>
              <p>Sättermon has a special place in esports. He has been playing Counter-Strike since he was 13 and making money from doing so since he was 17. As leader of Fnatic, he spends 200 days a year on the road, from South Korea to the Netherlands to the US. He is not the most talented of his peers and he doesn't have the fastest reactions. But he bosses matches because of his experience, anticipating opponents' moves and tactics and directing his own teammates in a game that's actually less about killing than communication and strategy. "Counter-Strike was the game that made esports big [in Europe]," says Ralf Reichert, the CEO of the Electronic Sports League, which puts on the IEM. "And cArn is one of the very few players who have helped to shape the history of Counter-Strike."</p>
              <p>In the most modern of sports, cArn is the last pioneer left standing. The young guns that he trained are now coming for him.Sättermon never thought that he could make a living playing computer games.</p>
