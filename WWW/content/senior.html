              <p>Nova “Dark” Betrayed is a Battlefield 4 player who specializes in “Quick Scooping”.  He started his YouTube channel in 2012 when the quick scoping snipers had already become popular on YouTube.   With stylized filters jump cuts and almost unbelievable k/d (kill to death) ratios Dark – Betrayed quickly and is widely considered one of the most talented battlefield 4 players today. After leaving for a short period and coming back in 2014 with the release of the Battlefield 4 game his channel consist of mostly Battlefield 4 and Counter-Strike: GO gameplay.</p>
              <p>Battlefield has a huge multiplayer following but has yet to really establish a competitive gaming online presence. This may be due to the major amount of time and effort spent fixing some of the games bugs and glitches with its multiplayer.  Battlefield has always been a franchise that prides itself on its massive maps and beautiful environment. Hopefully with the advent of next-gen consoles and greater more powerful hardware for the PC games like these with this much detail and fidelity will be more successful in the future.

              <p>The Battlefield franchise has always been a part of who I am as a gamer. I used to be a competitive gamer in BFBC:2 and Battlefield 3 who was fortunate enough to win several big titles and leagues. Expanding upon my personal success I decided to start mentoring and sharing tips and tricks for Battlefield 3 straight from the competitive scene. Not long into my quest on YouTube I met up with some kick ass people such as Levelcap, Jackrags, and Matimi0 and continue with many epic Battlefield 4 gameplays, tips, tricks and guides!</p>
